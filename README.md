Impact-Demos
============

This repository houses any demos I have made for the ImpactJS framework.

###There are currently 2 demos: ###

###ArrowScreenScrollDemo ### is a demo that allows the player to move the screen with the arrow keys while not being able to move beyond the map edges.

###NameInitialsScreen### is a demonstration of creating a visual text entry screen (ex: entering your initials for a high score screen). The example code can be changed to allow any length of string by changing the stringLimit variable in the main class.
